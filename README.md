Pizza Franchise Location Recommendation
=========
Hypothesis
----------
The city of Seoul has 22,836 commercial areas according to official Seoul City Statistics. Through KNN clustering that reduced the number of commercial areas into smaller clusters, we believe the relative size of each cluster will present the approximate deliverable market size of a pizza franchise. We have plotted all the stores of the biggest four franchises which are shown with the clusters. This information will be a good indicator for a person who is planning on opening a new franchise store in Seoul. We assume the best location will be near clusters where there are few existing pins and the size of the cluster itself is big.
